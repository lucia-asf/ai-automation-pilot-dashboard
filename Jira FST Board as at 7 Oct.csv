* [Inducement] “Your donation will directly help cover: Flights and transport to Slovakia, Accommodation and meals during the tournament, Ice time and training camps in the lead-up, Team gear and essential equipment.”
* [Membership/Fees] “Unlike many elite sports, para athletes often fund their own travel, training, equipment, and accommodation.”
* [Ticketing/Admission] “Donate now and be part of this history-making journey, and they are 100% tax deductable.”
* [Advertising] “Help Lynda get to the 2025 Women’s Para World Championships.”
* [Sponsorship] “I’m incredibly proud to share that I’ve been selected to represent Australia at the 2025 Women’s Para Ice Hockey World Championships.”
* [Personal Contact] “If you believe in equality in sport, representation on the world stage, and empowering disabled athletes, I’d be so grateful for your contribution.”

Severity: medium; Notes: The text contains elements of inducement by soliciting donations for travel and expenses related to participation in a sporting event. It also touches on membership/fees and ticketing/admission by implying that contributions are necessary for participation. The overall tone promotes a personal cause, which may lead to off-platform solicitations.

Evidence:

* [Inducement] “Once again, any generous donations will be greatly appreciated and will help me live out my dream of competing on the world stage.”
* [Membership/Fees] “it is extremely hard to fund my own campaign at such a young age while also training full-time.”
* [Ticketing/Admission] “I do not want to continue solely relying on my parents for financial support in covering all the costs of my travel, accommodation, charter boats, etc.”

Severity: medium; Notes: The text contains multiple instances of solicitation for funding assistance, which falls under the category of inducement. It also mentions the challenges of funding a competitive sailing campaign, which could imply a request for financial support.

Severity: medium; Notes: The text suggests fundraising for an athlete's competition costs, which may imply inducement and sponsorship.

Evidence:

* [Inducement] “Each player faces around $5,000 in expenses, and as a self-funded team... we rely entirely on athletes, families, and community support.”
* [Membership/Fees] “Without support, the financial barrier risks preventing some of our most dedicated players from representing Australia.”

* [Advertising] “Every donation — big or small — makes a difference.”
* [Personal Contact] “...allow them to focus on performance and preparation.”

Severity: medium; Notes: The text discusses financial support for the team, which may imply inducement for donations. It mentions specific costs and the need for community support, which could be interpreted as soliciting funds. While it does not directly promote goods/services, the context suggests a fundraising effort that requires careful review.

* Personal Contact: 0.30

Evidence:

* [Inducement] “I urgently need your help to raise $7,500 to cover such costs as the entry fee and damage deposit, as well as my travel and accommodation.”
* [Sponsorship] “Through my partnership with the Australian Sports Foundation, any donation you can give over $2 is tax deductible.”
* [Membership/Fees] “I urgently need your help to raise $7,500 to cover such costs as the entry fee and damage deposit.”
* [Ticketing/Admission] “I urgently need your help to raise $7,500 to cover such costs as the entry fee and damage deposit.”
* [Advertising] “any donation you can give over $2 is tax deductible.”
* [Personal Contact] “Thank you so much for your encouragement and generosity.”

Severity: high; Notes: The text contains multiple signals of inducement, as it solicits donations to cover specific costs associated with participation in an event. It also implies sponsorship through the mention of a partnership with the Australian Sports Foundation, which may suggest commercial support. Additionally, the request for funds could be interpreted as a form of membership or fees for participation.

* Membership/Fees: 0.65
* Ticketing/Admission: 0.55
* Advertising: 0.45
* Sponsorship: 0.40
* Personal Contact: 0.30

Evidence:

* [Inducement] “But I can’t do it alone. International competition is an amazing opportunity, but it also comes with significant costs—and that’s where I need your help.”
* [Membership/Fees] “Your contributions will go directly toward: Travel and accommodation: Getting to Hungary and staying during the event”
* [Ticketing/Admission] “Your contributions will go directly toward: Entry fees and local transport”
* [Advertising] “Every bit of support brings me closer to the start line and fuels my dream of racing for Australia with pride.”
* [Sponsorship] “Thank you for being part of this adventure. I’m ready to give it everything I’ve got for our community and our country.”
* [Personal Contact] “Your support—whether it’s a donation or simply sharing this with your network—makes a huge difference.”

Severity: high; Notes: The text suggests seeking financial support for travel and gear, which falls under inducement. It also implies potential membership or fees for contributions and mentions competition expenses, which could be interpreted as ticketing/admission. The overall tone encourages donations, which is against the guidelines.

Severity: medium; Notes: The text contains elements that suggest fundraising for personal travel expenses, which may imply inducement. Additionally, there are references to representing a club and community, which could be interpreted as sponsorship. The request for support and mention of costs associated with the trip may also raise concerns regarding membership or fees.

Evidence:

* [Sponsorship] “Izacc has been officially selected for the Joflow Basketball Academy Basketball Tour: Philippines 2026.”
* [Personal Contact] “Let's make this dream a reality for the Autistic Baller!”

Severity: high; Notes: The text contains multiple signals of inducement, as it solicits funds for a specific purpose and mentions specific amounts needed for deposits and fees. It also implies urgency and limited availability, which can be seen as a pressure tactic. Additionally, it suggests a commercial aspect by promoting a basketball tour.

* Membership/Fees: 0.75
* Ticketing/Admission: 0.65
* Sponsorship: 0.60
* Advertising: 0.55
* Personal Contact: 0.50

Evidence:

* [Inducement] “Your support can make a huge difference. Any contribution - big or small - can help offset the financial burden of training and competing at the highest level.”
* [Membership/Fees] “The costs of elite sport are significant. Training camps, international and domestic competitions, registration fees, coaching, and travel expenses all add up.”
* [Ticketing/Admission] “Your generosity will allow me to continue chasing my dreams, represent Australia on the world stage, and strive for success at the 2028 Olympic Games.”
* [Sponsorship] “I would love your support as I work towards my next big goal the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles!”
* [Advertising] “Your support can make a huge difference.”
* [Personal Contact] “my Mum and I cover these costs ourselves.”

Severity: medium; Notes: The text contains elements of inducement by requesting financial support for training and competition expenses. It also touches on membership/fees and ticketing/admission through the mention of costs associated with elite sports. While it does not explicitly direct donors off-platform, the overall tone suggests a solicitation for contributions.

LLM classification:

* Inducement: 0.90
* Membership/Fees: 0.70
* Ticketing/Admission: 0.60

Evidence:

* [Inducement] “Every tax deductible donation of $2 or more will help Noah reach his goal, however, Noah has created the following support categories: Platinum - $5,000, Gold - $1,000, Silver - $100, Bronze - $50.”

* [Ticketing/Admission] “Support AMOUNT Platinum - $5,000 Gold - $1,000 Silver - $100 Bronze - $50.”

Severity: high; Notes: The text suggests inducements for donations with specific amounts and categories, which may violate the guidelines regarding offering benefits in exchange for donations. Additionally, it implies a structured support system that could be interpreted as a membership or fee-based model.

LLM classification:

* Inducement: 0.85
* Membership/Fees: 0.65
* Personal Contact: 0.55

Evidence:

* [Inducement] “I am reaching out to offset the cost of travelling to play. Any donation you can make will significantly help my ability to compete.”
* [Membership/Fees] “Unfortunately, inline hockey isn’t a well-funded sport, and we must cover the cost of competing ourselves.”
* [Personal Contact] “please consider sharing this around for other people or businesses who may be interested in helping a young local athlete.”

Severity: medium; Notes: The text suggests soliciting donations to cover personal travel expenses for a sports competition, which falls under inducement. It also implies a need for financial support due to the lack of funding in the sport, which could be interpreted as a membership or fee-related request. Additionally, there is a call to share the request, which may lead to personal contact off-platform.

* [Advertising] “Support Chelsea’s Volleyball goals by donating.”
* [Membership/Fees] “All donations will be greatly appreciated and are tax deductible.”
* [Personal Contact] “instagram - @chelsdurbs”

Severity: medium; Notes: The text suggests soliciting donations for Chelsea's volleyball goals, which falls under inducement. It also includes promotional language that could be interpreted as advertising. The mention of tax-deductible donations may imply a membership or fee structure. Additionally, the inclusion of personal contact information could lead to off-platform solicitation.

* Ticketing/Admission: 0.65
* Advertising: 0.60
* Sponsorship: 0.55
* Personal Contact: 0.50

Evidence:

* [Inducement] “All funds will go directly towards upcoming competitions, training, development and coaching at ATOS HQ.”
* [Membership/Fees] “With your donation, you will receive a tax-deductible receipt by email as soon as funds have been received into the Australian Sports Foundation account.”
* [Ticketing/Admission] “India appreciates all of the support and welcomes you to become a crucial part of her journey throughout the 2025/26 year and beyond.”
* [Advertising] “Your support will allow India to focus entirely on her training, development, and performance.”
* [Sponsorship] “All funds will go directly towards upcoming competitions, training, development and coaching.”

Evidence:

* [Membership/Fees] “I must compete in qualifying events with my horse across Australia. These events are essential but costly, with each one costing between $5,000–$9,000.”

* [Sponsorship] “I launched my logo May I rise to help inspire the next generation.”
* [Personal Contact] “Please feel free to follow me on social media.”

Severity: high; Notes: The text contains multiple signals of inducement, as it solicits donations to support the individual's journey to compete in events. It also mentions costs associated with participation, which could imply a need for financial support. Additionally, there are references to social media contact, which may direct potential donors off-platform.

* [Membership/Fees] “We are raising funding for Hayden to attend a volleyball development camp in Canada.”
* [Ticketing/Admission] “This trip will allow Hayden to play against some of the best youth teams in the world.”
* [Advertising] “Hayden has recently returned from Canberra where he trained with the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS).”
* [Sponsorship] “Hayden has been selected for the Brisbane Olympics 2032 development squad (AIS).”
* [Gambling] “This trip will allow Hayden to play against some of the best youth teams in the world.”

Severity: high; Notes: The text suggests fundraising for a volleyball camp, which may imply inducement for donations. It also mentions tax deductibility, which can be seen as a commercial benefit. The overall context raises concerns regarding compliance with the organization's guidelines.

* Membership/Fees: 0.65
* Ticketing/Admission: 0.55
* Advertising: 0.45
* Sponsorship: 0.40
* Personal Contact: 0.35

Evidence:

* [Inducement] “Every donation is tax-deductible, so not only are you helping me chase my dream, but you can also claim your contribution at tax time.”
* [Membership/Fees] “Costs like travel, accommodation, uniforms, and competition fees add up quickly.”

* [Advertising] “Any contribution helps me.”
* [Sponsorship] “I’m ready to take the next big leap.”

Severity: medium; Notes: The text suggests a solicitation for donations to cover personal expenses related to competition, which falls under the category of inducement. It also mentions tax-deductible donations, which may imply a commercial aspect. The request for support and sharing the story could be seen as a form of advertising.

* Personal Contact: 0.50

Evidence:

* [Inducement] “The donations from this fundraiser will ultimately go towards costs for flights, accommodations, gear and more general fees that come with the league.”
* [Membership/Fees] “The AWIHL is not cheap and as a full-time student it is hard to afford on my own.”
* [Ticketing/Admission] “Any contributions are greatly appreciated, from the smallest amounts to the biggest.”
* [Sponsorship] “I am looking to raise money for the 2025-2026 AWIHL season as the Melbourne Ducks now enter our first full season of hockey.”
* [Advertising] “Any of your donations will help me continue chasing my dream.”
* [Personal Contact] “Thank you for any support, even just taking a look at this page.”

Severity: medium; Notes: The text suggests fundraising for personal expenses related to participation in a sports league, which may imply inducement and membership fees. It does not directly promote commercial products or services, but the request for donations for personal costs raises compliance concerns.

* Ticketing/Admission: 0.55
* Advertising: 0.45

* [Inducement] “Any donation, no matter the size, will make a big difference and motivate him in achieving his personal best.”
* [Ticketing/Admission] “Please consider supporting Elias as he competes in this exciting event.”

Severity: medium; Notes: The text suggests soliciting donations to cover travel and accommodation expenses for a youth sports event, which falls under the category of inducement. It encourages financial support without offering goods or services in return, but it does imply a need for financial contributions.

* Sponsorship: 0.55
* Advertising: 0.45
* Personal Contact: 0.40

Evidence:

* [Inducement] “we are turning to the kindness and generosity of friends, family, and supporters.”
* [Membership/Fees] “The total cost of the tour is around $10,000, which includes travel, accommodation, training fees, and other expenses.”
* [Ticketing/Admission] “Your donation, no matter how small, will bring us one step closer to making this dream come true.”
* [Sponsorship] “Your support means the world to us, and we promise to keep you updated on Xavier's progress throughout the tour.”
* [Advertising] “help him achieve his dreams!”
* [Personal Contact] “we are reaching out to ask for your support for our talented 13-year-old son, Xavier.”

Severity: high; Notes: The text contains multiple signals of inducement, as it solicits donations for a specific purpose (Xavier's soccer tour) and outlines the costs involved. It also implies a personal connection and gratitude towards potential donors, which may encourage contributions.

Evidence:

* [Inducement] “My goal is $30,000 which will provide me with the opportunity to compete against some of the best shooters in the world.”
* [Membership/Fees] “Fundraising will also provide me with covering the pre competition costs such as travel and equipment and also with accommodation and training in the months beforehand.”
* [Personal Contact] “However, this can only be made possible by the support of organisations and individuals such as you.”
* [Advertising] “the ASF provides a great easy fundraising campaign that is tax deductable.”
* [Ticketing/Admission] “Even $10 will make difference and in the words of Paul Kelly, 'from little things, big things grow'.”

Severity: medium; Notes: The text contains elements of inducement by soliciting funds for participation in a competition, which may imply offering benefits in exchange for donations. It also mentions fundraising campaigns that could be interpreted as membership or fees. The overall tone suggests a personal appeal for financial support.

* Membership/Fees: 0.75
* Ticketing/Admission: 0.65
* Advertising: 0.55
* Sponsorship: 0.50
* Personal Contact: 0.45

Evidence:

* [Inducement] “we need your support to make it happen. The funds raised will help cover the costs of Cooper's training at the academy”
* [Membership/Fees] “The total cost, excluding flights, is $45,000”
* [Ticketing/Admission] “any contribution, no matter the size, will make a significant difference.”
* [Advertising] “we are hopeful to raise as much as possible to support Cooper’s dream”
* [Sponsorship] “helping Cooper take this next step in his football career.”
* [Personal Contact] “Thank you for believing in him!”

Severity: high; Notes: The text contains multiple signals of inducement, as it solicits financial support for Cooper's training, which is a regulated activity. It mentions a specific amount needed ($45,000) and encourages contributions, which aligns with inducement and fundraising practices that require careful review.

Evidence:

Evidence:

* [Inducement] “By donating through the Australian Sports Foundation, you can provide 100% tax-deductible support to help cover: Travel Expenses, Training Fees, Tournament Costs, Equipment Needs.”
* [Membership/Fees] “This needs to be self-funded.”
* [Ticketing/Admission] “Aidan's key tournaments and commitments include: April 2025 – Australian Youth Water Polo Championships, Perth.”

* [Membership/Fees] “the combined costs of training, travel, accommodation, competition fees, uniforms, and equipment exceed $30,000 annually.”

* [Advertising] “Any financial support would make a meaningful difference in helping me pursue my goals and proudly represent Australia on the world stage.”

Severity: high; Notes: The text suggests financial support for personal goals, which may imply inducement.

* Sponsorship: 0.65
* Advertising: 0.60
* Ticketing/Admission: 0.55

Evidence:

* [Inducement] “the cost to keep me racing at an international level was in excess of $200k...reaching out for support for the 2026 season”
* [Membership/Fees] “Any support provided, in excess of $2 through the Australian Sports Foundation is also tax deductable”

* [Advertising] “Every single $1 received goes directly to supporting me race”
* [Ticketing/Admission] “BSB attracts viewers worldwide of around 40 million per year”
* [Personal Contact] “reaching out for support for the 2026 season”

Severity: high; Notes: The text contains multiple signals of inducement, as it solicits financial support for racing activities, which could be interpreted as offering benefits in exchange for donations. Additionally, it mentions tax deductibility, which may imply a financial transaction. The overall tone suggests a need for financial contributions to continue racing, which raises compliance concerns.

* Membership/Fees: 0.65
* Advertising: 0.55
* Sponsorship: 0.45
* Ticketing/Admission: 0.40
* Personal Contact: 0.35

Evidence:

* [Inducement] “...there are no match payments provided for appointments... that's why I'm reaching out for your support.”
* [Inducement] “Your contribution will help cover the ongoing costs of travel, preparation, and equipment required to maintain peak performance...”

Severity: high; Notes: The text suggests soliciting donations to cover personal expenses related to officiating, which falls under inducement. It also implies a need for financial support without offering goods or services in return, which is a violation of the guidelines.

Evidence:

* [Advertising] “A place where the next generation will gather, laugh, celebrate wins, commiserate losses, and always feel at home at The Nest.”
* [Sponsorship] “A modern canteen will mean safer equipment, easier food prep, and less stress for those who give up their Saturdays to help.”
* [Ticketing/Admission] “A welcoming canteen is where they’ll line up with gold coins in hand, wide-eyed for a hot jam donut or a sausage roll after the game.”
* [Personal Contact] “Join us in making this happen.”

Severity: medium; Notes: The text suggests a fundraising initiative that could be interpreted as an inducement for donations. Phrases like 'Every dollar counts!' and 'Donate today' imply a solicitation for funds, which falls under the category of inducement. Additionally, there are elements that could be seen as advertising or sponsorship, particularly in the context of promoting the canteen and its benefits to the community.

* Personal Contact: 0.50

Evidence:

* [Inducement] “Any financial support will make a world of difference. No contribution is too small, and every donation helps Sophie get closer to her goals.”
* [Membership/Fees] “Sophie is hoping to be paired with an Australian business that will help fundraise, network, mentor and support her.”
* [Advertising] “The $1M challenge is driven by 5 time Olympian Nat Cook OAM and is helping Australian athletes like Sophie to overcome the financial hurdles of achieving success in her sport.”
* [Sponsorship] “The business will become an integral part of her team.”
* [Ticketing/Admission] “Together they will work to raise the necessary funds to cover her training, travel and competition costs.”
* [Personal Contact] “For more information, click here to read about the Million Dollar Challenge.”

Severity: high; Notes: The text contains multiple signals of inducement, suggesting financial support in exchange for contributions, which is against the guidelines. Additionally, there are elements of sponsorship and advertising that imply commercial support.

* Membership/Fees: 0.75
* Ticketing/Admission: 0.65
* Sponsorship: 0.60
* Advertising: 0.55
* Personal Contact: 0.50

Evidence:

* [Inducement] “We are humbly reaching out for support in helping Elijah take this next step. Every contribution, no matter the size, will go directly towards his schooling and football journey in America.”
* [Membership/Fees] “the costs of tuition, travel, and living expenses are beyond what we can manage on our own”
* [Ticketing/Admission] “Every contribution, no matter the size, will go directly towards his schooling and football journey in America.”
* [Sponsorship] “Your generosity will not only bless Elijah, but our entire family, as we stand by him in faith and hope for his future.”
* [Advertising] “We are humbly reaching out for support in helping Elijah take this next step.”
* [Personal Contact] “Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your kindness, prayers, and support.”

Severity: high; Notes: The text suggests soliciting donations for Elijah's education and football journey, which falls under inducement. It also implies potential membership/fees and ticketing/admission aspects due to the mention of costs associated with schooling and travel.
