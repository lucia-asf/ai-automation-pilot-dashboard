LLM classification:

* Inducement: 0.90
* Ticketing/Admission: 0.70
* Advertising: 0.50

Evidence:

* [Inducement] “I’m hoping to raise some money to help my son Aiden get back on his feet to purchase a new bike”
* [Ticketing/Admission] “ensure he can not only race in the final round of the season”
* [Advertising] “the boys’ pride and joy. Both Aiden and Flynn had worked hard to save the money to buy them”

Severity: medium; Notes: The text suggests raising money for a new bike, which falls under inducement. It also implies participation in a race, which could be interpreted as ticketing/admission. There are elements of personal contact and emotional appeal that may suggest a solicitation.

* [Membership/Fees] “Liam’s fundraising partnership with the Australian Sports Foundation allow for donations of $2 or more to be tax deductible.”

LLM classification:

* Inducement: 0.85
* Membership/Fees: 0.10
* Ticketing/Admission: 0.05

Evidence:

* [Inducement] “we are seeking support to help cover the costs of flights, accommodation, costumes, entry fees & coaching.”
* [Membership/Fees] “Any donation, no matter the size, would be greatly appreciated and would significantly help Cooper continue to achieve his dreams.”

Severity: medium; Notes: The text indicates a request for donations to cover specific costs related to Cooper's skating journey, which can be interpreted as a material inducement. While it does not explicitly offer benefits in exchange for donations, the mention of covering costs may imply an expectation of support tied to specific expenses.

* [Advertising] “support my competition and training travel costs to qualify for my fourth Olympic Games”
* [Personal Contact] “Please watch me this season for free at https://watch.fis-ski.com/section/Alpine”

Severity: medium; Notes: The text suggests a fundraising campaign that may imply inducements for donations, as well as potential membership or ticketing elements. It does not explicitly direct donors off-platform, but the mention of watching for free could imply a promotional aspect.

LLM classification:

* Sponsorship: 0.85
* Inducement: 0.75
* Membership/Fees: 0.65

Evidence:

* [Sponsorship] “Your sponsorship would be greatly appreciated and would play a vital role in allowing me to perform at my best.”
* [Inducement] “I am seeking support to help cover my travel and competition expenses.”
* [Membership/Fees] “significant personal and financial investment.”

Severity: medium; Notes: The text suggests a sponsorship request and implies benefits for the sponsor, which falls under the sponsorship category. Additionally, it indicates a need for financial support in exchange for sponsorship, which aligns with inducement. The mention of personal financial investment could also relate to membership or fees.

* Membership/Fees: 0.75
* Ticketing/Admission: 0.65
* Advertising: 0.60
* Sponsorship: 0.55
* Personal Contact: 0.50

Evidence:

* [Inducement] “Your donation will directly help cover: Flights and transport to Slovakia, Accommodation and meals during the tournament, Ice time and training camps in the lead-up, Team gear and essential equipment.”
* [Membership/Fees] “Unlike many elite sports, para athletes often fund their own travel, training, equipment, and accommodation.”
* [Ticketing/Admission] “Donate now and be part of this history-making journey, and they are 100% tax deductable.”
* [Advertising] “Help Lynda get to the 2025 Women’s Para World Championships.”
* [Sponsorship] “I’m incredibly proud to share that I’ve been selected to represent Australia at the 2025 Women’s Para Ice Hockey World Championships.”
* [Personal Contact] “If you believe in equality in sport, representation on the world stage, and empowering disabled athletes, I’d be so grateful for your contribution.”

Severity: medium; Notes: The text contains elements of inducement by soliciting donations for travel and expenses related to participation in a sporting event. It also touches on membership/fees and ticketing/admission by implying that contributions are necessary for participation. The overall tone promotes a personal cause, which may lead to off-platform solicitations.

* Personal Contact: 0.50

Evidence:

* [Inducement] “Any donation, even the smallest, will support me on this career path with essential costs and expenses and being involved in My Journey!!”
* [Membership/Fees] “Financially it has been a constant struggle to be able to consistently play on the tour with the overloading costs of coaches, equipment, accommodation, travel expenses etc.”
* [Ticketing/Admission] “The Mens ITF Tour continues for 52 weeks of the year around the globe requiring me to constantly travel attempting to chase these tournaments on a strict budget.”
* [Advertising] “I wish to always be at Optimal Health and Strength through Diet and Body Maintenance to be able to continue this journey, climbing the rankings, travelling the world for many years to come.”
* [Sponsorship] “The many ups and downs have only allowed me to work harder mentally, physically and tactically to be able to compete at the highest level.”
* [Personal Contact] “I have worked hard to earn 2 Professional Men's Ranking Points so far and within the top 4,500 players in the world.”

Severity: high; Notes: The text contains multiple signals of inducement, suggesting that donations are needed to support the individual's career in tennis. It also implies financial struggles related to participation in the tour, which could be interpreted as a solicitation for funds.

Evidence:

* [Inducement] “Nicolas is seeking to raise a small portion of that amount over the next four years.”
* [Membership/Fees] “Trampolining is a self-funded sport. The costs of training, travel, exercise physiology (EP), physiotherapy, equipment and competing both nationally and internationally exceed $40,000 annually.”
* [Advertising] “Your tax deductible contribution will directly support him in representing Australia at the highest national and international level of competition.”

* [Ticketing/Admission] “Nicolas is aiming to raise a very small portion of the total costs involved to compete in an Olympic cycle.”
* [Personal Contact] “Thank you for believing in Nicolas and helping him reach even greater heights.”

Severity: medium; Notes: The text suggests fundraising for an athlete's competition costs, which may imply inducement and sponsorship. It mentions tax-deductible contributions, which could be interpreted as a form of membership or fees. The overall tone encourages support but must ensure compliance with guidelines regarding solicitation and inducements.

* Ticketing/Admission: 0.55
* Sponsorship: 0.45
* Advertising: 0.40
* Personal Contact: 0.35

Evidence:

* [Inducement] “Each player faces around $5,000 in expenses, and as a self-funded team... we rely entirely on athletes, families, and community support.”
* [Membership/Fees] “Without support, the financial barrier risks preventing some of our most dedicated players from representing Australia.”
* [Ticketing/Admission] “...an event entrance fee of approximately $4000.”
* [Sponsorship] “...supporting the growth of floorball in Australia, and giving our athletes the chance to proudly carry the Australian spirit.”
* [Advertising] “Every donation — big or small — makes a difference.”
* [Personal Contact] “...allow them to focus on performance and preparation.”

Severity: medium; Notes: The text discusses financial support for the team, which may imply inducement for donations. It mentions specific costs and the need for community support, which could be interpreted as soliciting funds. While it does not directly promote goods/services, the context suggests a fundraising effort that requires careful review.

Evidence:

* [Inducement] “Donating to support this journey will enable a young(ish) rider to fulfil some lifelong dreams, that despite working full time cannot be realised by her salary alone.”
* [Ticketing/Admission] “Funds raised will go towards covering the costs of Paddy's plane ticket ($35K - sadly no frequent flyer points flights available) as well as entries, stabling, transport and accommodation while in the USA.”
* [Sponsorship] “All donations over $2 are tax deductible so if you can spare anything to support this dynamic duo please get on board their amazing journey!”
* [Alcohol] “lots of carrots and liquorice for the horses!”
* [Advertising] “With all of the world events getting in the way (pandemic = no flights!) the goalposts had to change a little!”
* [Membership/Fees] “any support is greatly appreciated to help fund this incredible journey with 2028 and 2032 still being big years to aim towards!”

Severity: high; Notes: The text contains multiple signals of inducement, ticketing/admission, and sponsorship, which suggest commercial promotion and solicitation for donations. It also mentions alcohol in a context that could imply promotion.

* Personal Contact: 0.30

Evidence:

* [Inducement] “But I can’t do it alone. International competition is an amazing opportunity, but it also comes with significant costs—and that’s where I need your help.”
* [Membership/Fees] “Your contributions will go directly toward: Travel and accommodation: Getting to Hungary and staying during the event”

* [Personal Contact] “Your support—whether it’s a donation or simply sharing this with your network—makes a huge difference.”

Severity: high; Notes: The text suggests seeking financial support for travel and gear, which falls under inducement. It also implies potential membership or fees for contributions and mentions competition expenses, which could be interpreted as ticketing/admission.

Evidence:

Severity: medium; Notes: The text contains elements that suggest fundraising for personal travel expenses, which may imply inducement. Additionally, there are references to representing a club and community, which could be interpreted as sponsorship. The request for support and mention of costs associated with the trip may also raise concerns regarding membership or fees.

Evidence:

Severity: high; Notes: The text contains multiple signals of inducement, as it solicits funds for a specific purpose and mentions specific amounts needed for deposits and fees. It also implies urgency and limited availability, which can be seen as a pressure tactic. Additionally, it suggests a commercial aspect by promoting a basketball tour.

* Membership/Fees: 0.75
* Advertising: 0.65
* Sponsorship: 0.60
* Ticketing/Admission: 0.55
* Personal Contact: 0.50

Evidence:

* [Inducement] “Please consider a donation, any amount is greatly appreciated - stand with Connor and share his achievements in 2025 and beyond.”
* [Membership/Fees] “The Australian Sports Foundation offers athletes a platform to gain financial support via a donation from companies where they will be supplied a formal tax invoice to claim their tax rebates.”
* [Advertising] “Please consider a donation, any amount is greatly appreciated - stand with Connor and share his achievements in 2025 and beyond.”
* [Sponsorship] “Connor is fortunate enough to have support with the Trek Shimano Australia team and all their subsidiary suppliers.”
* [Ticketing/Admission] “Connor will be travelling to Europe in April for 2 months for 3 Junior World Cup series events.”
* [Personal Contact] “What the money is spent on is shown in the athlete's profile so you can see just how much and where you have helped Connor achieve his goals and aspirations.”

Severity: high; Notes: The text contains multiple instances of solicitation for donations, which falls under the category of inducement. Additionally, it mentions the Australian Sports Foundation's platform for financial support, which may imply membership or fees. The overall tone suggests a strong push for financial contributions, which raises compliance concerns.

* [Membership/Fees] “The costs of elite sport are significant. Training camps, international and domestic competitions, registration fees, coaching, and travel expenses all add up.”
* [Ticketing/Admission] “Your generosity will allow me to continue chasing my dreams, represent Australia on the world stage, and strive for success at the 2028 Olympic Games.”
* [Sponsorship] “I would love your support as I work towards my next big goal the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles!”
* [Advertising] “Your support can make a huge difference.”
* [Personal Contact] “my Mum and I cover these costs ourselves.”

Severity: medium; Notes: The text contains elements of inducement by requesting financial support for training and competition expenses. It also touches on membership/fees and ticketing/admission through the mention of costs associated with elite sports. While it does not explicitly direct donors off-platform, the overall tone suggests a solicitation for contributions.

Evidence:

* [Inducement] “I am reaching out to offset the cost of travelling to play. Any donation you can make will significantly help my ability to compete.”

* [Personal Contact] “please consider sharing this around for other people or businesses who may be interested in helping a young local athlete.”

Severity: medium; Notes: The text suggests soliciting donations to cover personal travel expenses for a sports competition, which falls under inducement. It also implies a need for financial support due to the lack of funding in the sport, which could be interpreted as a membership or fee-related request. Additionally, there is a call to share the request, which may lead to personal contact off-platform.

* Personal Contact: 0.50

Evidence:

* [Inducement] “I’m asking for your support. Your donation will directly help me cover the costs of competing in the 2025 season.”
* [Membership/Fees] “In fact, we often have to pay out of our own pockets for travel, accommodation, uniforms, equipment, ice time, and more.”
* [Ticketing/Admission] “Every season costs thousands of dollars, and this year is no different.”
* [Advertising] “Whether it’s $10 or $100, every bit helps and goes straight toward keeping me on the ice.”
* [Sponsorship] “If you’re passionate about supporting Indigenous athletes, women’s sport, or just helping someone chase their dream.”
* [Personal Contact] “Thank you so much for your support and belief in me.”

Severity: medium; Notes: The text contains elements of inducement by soliciting donations to cover personal costs associated with playing in a sports league. It also touches on membership/fees and ticketing/admission by discussing the financial burdens of participation in the league.

* Membership/Fees: 0.65
* Ticketing/Admission: 0.55
* Advertising: 0.45
* Sponsorship: 0.40
* Personal Contact: 0.30

Evidence:

* [Inducement] “Competing at this level comes with costs such as travel, accommodation, tournament fees, and other expenses. To help cover these, I’ve set up a fundraising page through the Australian Sports Foundation.”
* [Membership/Fees] “Competing at this level comes with costs such as travel, accommodation, tournament fees, and other expenses.”

* [Sponsorship] “I’m proud to have been selected to represent the Queensland Suburban Kelpies.”
* [Personal Contact] “I’m truly grateful for any contribution that helps me take this next step in my sporting career.”

* [Inducement] “Every donation is tax-deductible, so not only are you helping me chase my dream, but you can also claim your contribution at tax time.”
* [Membership/Fees] “Costs like travel, accommodation, uniforms, and competition fees add up quickly.”
* [Ticketing/Admission] “I’m reaching out to my community for support to help me fund my World Championship dream.”
* [Advertising] “Any contribution helps me.”
* [Sponsorship] “I’m ready to take the next big leap.”
* [Personal Contact] “Follow my journey on Instagram.”

Severity: medium; Notes: The text suggests a solicitation for donations to cover personal expenses related to competition, which falls under the category of inducement. It also mentions tax-deductible donations, which may imply a commercial aspect. The request for support and sharing the story could be seen as a form of advertising.

* [Membership/Fees] “None of these opportunities are free, or sponsored or even subsidised, except by the bank of Mum and Dad.”
* [Ticketing/Admission] “All donations will cover future travel, including flights, accommodation, meals, ground transport, tournament entry fees, access to training facilities plus coaching and management fees.”
* [Advertising] “Remember, all donations are tax deductable!!”

Severity: high; Notes: The text contains multiple signals of inducement for donations, which is against the guidelines. It suggests that donations are needed for travel and development, which implies a commercial benefit. Additionally, it mentions tax deductibility, which can be seen as an inducement.

* Advertising: 0.45
* Personal Contact: 0.40

Evidence:

* [Inducement] “we are turning to the kindness and generosity of friends, family, and supporters.”
* [Membership/Fees] “The total cost of the tour is around $10,000, which includes travel, accommodation, training fees, and other expenses.”
* [Ticketing/Admission] “Your donation, no matter how small, will bring us one step closer to making this dream come true.”
* [Sponsorship] “Your support means the world to us, and we promise to keep you updated on Xavier's progress throughout the tour.”
* [Advertising] “help him achieve his dreams!”
* [Personal Contact] “we are reaching out to ask for your support for our talented 13-year-old son, Xavier.”

Severity: high; Notes: The text contains multiple signals of inducement, as it solicits donations for a specific purpose (Xavier's soccer tour) and outlines the costs involved. It also implies a personal connection and gratitude towards potential donors, which may encourage contributions.

Evidence:

* [Inducement] “My goal is $30,000 which will provide me with the opportunity to compete against some of the best shooters in the world.”
* [Membership/Fees] “Fundraising will also provide me with covering the pre competition costs such as travel and equipment and also with accommodation and training in the months beforehand.”
* [Personal Contact] “However, this can only be made possible by the support of organisations and individuals such as you.”
* [Advertising] “the ASF provides a great easy fundraising campaign that is tax deductable.”
* [Ticketing/Admission] “Even $10 will make difference and in the words of Paul Kelly, 'from little things, big things grow'.”

Severity: medium; Notes: The text contains elements of inducement by soliciting funds for participation in a competition, which may imply offering benefits in exchange for donations. It also mentions fundraising campaigns that could be interpreted as membership or fees. The overall tone suggests a personal appeal for financial support.

Evidence:

* [Inducement] “Your contribution, regardless of the size, make a signficant impact and will help fund Zoe's travel expenses.”
* [Advertising] “Your contribution, regardless of the size, make a signficant impact and will help fund Zoe's travel expenses.”

* Sponsorship: 0.65
* Advertising: 0.60
* Ticketing/Admission: 0.55
* Personal Contact: 0.50

Evidence:

* [Inducement] “the cost to keep me racing at an international level was in excess of $200k...reaching out for support for the 2026 season”
* [Membership/Fees] “Any support provided, in excess of $2 through the Australian Sports Foundation is also tax deductable”

* [Advertising] “Every single $1 received goes directly to supporting me race”
* [Ticketing/Admission] “BSB attracts viewers worldwide of around 40 million per year”
* [Personal Contact] “reaching out for support for the 2026 season”

Severity: high; Notes: The text contains multiple signals of inducement, as it solicits financial support for racing activities, which could be interpreted as offering benefits in exchange for donations. Additionally, it mentions tax deductibility, which may imply a financial transaction. The overall tone suggests a need for financial contributions to continue racing, which raises compliance concerns.

* Ticketing/Admission: 0.55

Evidence:

* [Inducement] “If you can, would you please help me get to Hobart? A donation of just $10 would go a long way in helping me get on the field and represent my state.”
* [Membership/Fees] “A donation of just $10 would go a long way in helping me get on the field and represent my state.”
* [Ticketing/Admission] “A last minute chance tp represent Victoria for the first time in hockey!”

Severity: medium; Notes: The text suggests soliciting donations in exchange for the opportunity to participate in a sporting event, which falls under the category of inducement. Additionally, it implies a need for financial support for participation, which could be interpreted as a membership or fee-related solicitation.

* Advertising: 0.55

Evidence:

* [Inducement] “Your contribution will help cover the ongoing costs of travel, preparation, and equipment required to maintain peak performance...”

Severity: high; Notes: The text suggests soliciting donations to cover personal expenses related to officiating, which falls under inducement. It also implies a need for financial support without offering goods or services in return, which is a violation of the guidelines.

* Membership/Fees: 0.65
* Advertising: 0.55
* Sponsorship: 0.45
* Ticketing/Admission: 0.40
* Personal Contact: 0.30

Evidence:

* [Inducement] “Every dollar counts! #carnSale”
* [Membership/Fees] “Join us in making this happen. Donate today and be part of the story that keeps our club strong for years to come.”
* [Advertising] “A place where the next generation will gather, laugh, celebrate wins, commiserate losses, and always feel at home at The Nest.”
* [Sponsorship] “A modern canteen will mean safer equipment, easier food prep, and less stress for those who give up their Saturdays to help.”
* [Ticketing/Admission] “A welcoming canteen is where they’ll line up with gold coins in hand, wide-eyed for a hot jam donut or a sausage roll after the game.”
* [Personal Contact] “Join us in making this happen.”

Severity: medium; Notes: The text suggests a fundraising initiative that could be interpreted as an inducement for donations. Phrases like 'Every dollar counts!' and 'Donate today' imply a solicitation for funds, which falls under the category of inducement. Additionally, there are elements that could be seen as advertising or sponsorship, particularly in the context of promoting the canteen and its benefits to the community.

* Sponsorship: 0.60
* Advertising: 0.55
* Personal Contact: 0.50

Evidence:

* [Inducement] “We are humbly reaching out for support in helping Elijah take this next step. Every contribution, no matter the size, will go directly towards his schooling and football journey in America.”
* [Membership/Fees] “the costs of tuition, travel, and living expenses are beyond what we can manage on our own”
* [Ticketing/Admission] “Every contribution, no matter the size, will go directly towards his schooling and football journey in America.”
* [Sponsorship] “Your generosity will not only bless Elijah, but our entire family, as we stand by him in faith and hope for his future.”
* [Advertising] “We are humbly reaching out for support in helping Elijah take this next step.”
* [Personal Contact] “Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your kindness, prayers, and support.”

Severity: high; Notes: The text suggests soliciting donations for Elijah's education and football journey, which falls under inducement. It also implies potential membership/fees and ticketing/admission aspects due to the mention of costs associated with schooling and travel.
